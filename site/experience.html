        <p>
          I have some experience as a tutor, working with <a href="http://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a>. I made my own <a href="http://www.wyzant.com/Tutors/YourNewTutor">profile</a> and listed all the Subjects I can assist others in. Wyzant provides standardized tests for each subject that a tutor deems himselves capable of teaching. I passed all of the math related standardized tests and I applied to those in need while clients also contacted me to see if I'd be available to help them. I have several 5 star ratings and quoted reviews from my clients. <br><br> It is a great learning experience for all of us.
