        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>
          My name is Cody Troyer and I am that computer techy guy. 
          <br><br>
          I attended the University of California, Riverside where I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I now work in Lake Forest, CA at an inflight entertainment company called Global Eagle Entertainment (formerly known as DTI Software). My ideal goal is to find a company that suits me and my long term endeavors while also welcoming me as the creative and innovative body that I am. 
          <br><br>
          Since day one I have always leaned towards math and construction, whether it be one of the only kids in my preschool counting to a hundred or going home to play with tinker toys and legos. My mind has always been geared in the engineering path. It wasn't actually until 11th grade when I started to take a liking to programming. The first program I made was in my precalculus class: Guess my number on my TI-84 calculator. From there I began to look into C and C++. It was then when I knew what my major in college would be. Glad I did because I flourished and 4 years and several languages later, I had a toolbox filled with knowledge about data structures, graphics, compilers, operating systems, etc.
          <br><br>
          Since then, I have tried to explore a couple areas of computer science. A few that catch my eye are Artificial Intelligence, Video Game Design, Computer Networks, and Software Engineering. I have programmed several AI for video game computer controlled players. I know theres more to Artificial intelligence than video game applications, therefore I'd be more than happy to apply myself to learn more about this branch. In college, I took 2 video game courses and I really enjoyed them. I have tried on my own to design and create games, but I usually get stuck at the tedious parts (which makes sense why companies usually have full teams working on a game). I have an extremely basic understanding of servers and I would definitely be interested in learning more about them. I have been in the workplace for some time now and I have found that I really enjoy programming, regardless of what it is for. Because of that, I have decided that I must have some interest in Software Engineering.
          <br><br>
          I love computer science because it's a way of thinking. If someone is a master of computer science, he is a master of problem solving. That's what computer science consists of. How to solve a problem in a logical and systematic way that focuses on looking at your issue from different perspectives and finding an efficient solution. It's a unique skill and I am glad I chose this field to work on perfecting it.
          <br><br>
          Although my greatest strengths lie in logic and programming, I have an undying desire to explore other areas. Since my mother and girlfriend are both in the nutritional field of study, I have taken up quite the interest in health and nutrition. Also, there's a part of me that loves to go on adventures, I enjoy travelling, hiking, camping, swimming, anything outdoorsy: I'm in! 
          <br><br>
          All in all, I'm a simple, hard working, honest, down to earth guy, with a big heart and big dreams. If I set my mind to something, I don't stop until that something is complete.
